        # Development requirements
        The above requirements can be satisfied with minimal code - mainly just config. However we recognise that requirements can be more complex. Please provide details of application/functionality-specific requirements using the sections below. All custom requirements will take additional development time.
        
  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Custom Data Sources
      description: |
        For knowing the data source of a bubble, we assume that:

        - All Participant Bubbles allow viewing of local files in browser only and do not access data stored remotely anywhere.
        - All Destination Bubbles load data from a bubble, which will include data from multiple users.

        If a particular bubble uses a different source than this assumption, (e.g. a participant/destination bubble hybrid, or something that uses some other source such as an external storage API) please specify it here. Similarly if a new type of file is to be supported, detail that here, and provide a sample if possible.
  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Custom Set of Views
      description: |
        For deciding what views will be available within the experiences within each bubble, we assume that:

        - The experiences within all Participant Bubbles will not include any aggregate views, only individual tabs for different types of data
        - The experiences within all Destination Bubbles will include both individual details tabs (e.g. tables/maps) as well as aggregate views

        We further assume that all provided tabs will be the same ones we already have for those companies on existing experiences.

        If you require any new views or different sets of tabs than the standard set, for any of the experiences you listed, for any of the bubbles, please specify the requirements about which tabs/views you want in each bubble, in as much detail as possible, here.
  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Other customisations
      description: |
        If there are other special requirements, such as teacher features, analytics, unusual flows, different import requirements or storage requirements, please provide as much detail as possible here. Please note that anything more complex than the standard version as described above will take longer.
